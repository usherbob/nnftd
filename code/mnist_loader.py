mnist_loader
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A library to load the MNIST image data.  For details of the data
structures that are returned, see the doc string for ``load_data``.
The library also contains a helper method ``load_data_nn`` which
returns the data in a format well adapted for use with our neural
network code.

Note that the code requires the file ``../data/mnist.pkl``.  This is not
included in the repository.  It may be downloaded from:

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz

def load_data():
    """ Return the MNIST data as a tuple containing the training data,
    the validation data, and the test data.

    The ``training_data`` is returned as a tuple with two entries.
    The first entry contains the actual training images.  This is a
    numpy ndarray with 50,000 entries.  Each entry is, in turn, a
    numpy ndarray with 784 values, representing the 28 * 28 = 784
    pixels.

    The second entry in the ``training_data`` tuple is a numpy ndarray
    containing 50,000 entries.  Those entries are just the digit
    values (0...9) for the corresponding images contained in the first
    entry of the tuple.

    The ``validation_data`` and ``test_data`` are similar, except
    each contains only 10,000 images.

    Note that the format the data is returned in is well adapted for
    use by scikit-learn's SVM method, but not so well adapted for our
    neural network code.  For that, see the wrapper function
    ``load_data_nn``.

    values (integers) corresponding to the ``test_inputs``.
